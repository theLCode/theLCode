# I _am _Laura üêêüêï (she/her)‚ôÄÔ∏è

I talk a little bit about myself on my [website](https://lauralongoria.netlify.app) if you wish to check it out. Here's a few things I plan to work on/am working on now (listed by priority):
- Getting myself familiar with Godot again
- App development with Flutter
- Facial Recognition Profiled Smart Mirror
- Updating and trying to upgrade my website



Currently, I am a high school Computer Science teacher at Klein Oak High School, so I'm managing class time and planning along with my personal life and projects that I wish to work on. More specifically, I teach Texas Computer Science 1, 2, and 3, along with AP Computer Science Principles, Foundations of Cybersecurity, Digital Forensincs, Capstone Cybersecurity, and Video Game Design with Game Maker.

Along with my projects and work, I plan to start a YouTube channel that will document my progress with my projects and educational videos on CS basics. Though, I'm not sure when I'm going to implement this, but I do plan to soon.

I'll add on more onto this.
